A company has its own and outsourced employees.
For each employee, you want to record name, hours
worked and hourly rate. Outsourced employees
They also have an additional expense.

Employee pay corresponds to the hourly rate
multiplied by the hours worked, with the
outsourced employees still receive a bonus
corresponding to 110% of your additional expense.
